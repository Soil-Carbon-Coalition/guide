# guide

A major revision of http://soilcarboncoalition.org/files/MeasuringSoilCarbonChange.pdf to encompass more indicators of biological work and landscape function, and to facilitate shared and shareable intelligence on landscape function at local scales and actionable timeframes.

"This guide is about the fundamental processes that make our world go round. Not the actual physical spin, but how sunlight, especially when captured by green plants, drives everything that is important to us and our civilizations. It is about gauging fundamental biosphere function at specific locations. It is about monitoring changes in this function over time.

"The measurement and monitoring of the most powerful and creative planetary force is as much a social issue, involving beliefs and attitudes, as it is a technical one. There are many contexts and ways of thinking about biological work, water cycling, and soil carbon, and different perceptions on their importance. How you measure something depends on your purpose."
